# Class 1 â€” 08/22/2025

**Presenter:** Andrew Rosemberg

**Topic:** Course map; why PDE-constrained optimization; tooling overview; stability & state-space dynamics; Lyapunov; discretization issues

---

In this first class, we will introduce the course, outlining the topics that will be covered and the importance of PDE-constrained optimization. We discuss the tools that will be used throughout the course and provides an overview of stability and state-space dynamics, including Lyapunov stability. The class also touches on discretization issues that arise in the context of PDEs.

## Pre-requisites

- **Mathematical Background:** A solid understanding of calculus and linear algebra is essential. Familiarity with differential equations and optimization techniques is also needed.

- **Programming Skills:** Intermediate capacity in a programming language such as Julia, Python, or MATLAB is required for implementing the concepts discussed in class.

## Background Material

A few background materials have been selected to help you prepare for the course. Please review these resources before the first class:

- **Git**: Familiarity with Git for version control is recommended. Students should be comfortable with basic Git commands and workflows. Go through the [Git Basics](./background_materials/git_adventure_guide.md) guide to get started.

- **Julia**: The course will use Julia for programming assignments and projects. If you are new to Julia, go through either or all of these resources until you feel comfortable with the language:

    - [Julia for Beginners](https://juliaacademy.com/p/julia-for-beginners)
    - [Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML): Methods and Applications](https://book.sciml.ai/)
    - [Julia ML Course](https://adrianhill.de/julia-ml-course/)
